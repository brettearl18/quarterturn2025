## 5. Optimization & Recommendations

- **Monitor Firestore reads/writes:** Use batched reads, cache where possible.
- **Image optimization:** Use thumbnails, compress images before upload.
- **OpenAI API:** Limit prompt/response size, cache results if possible.
- **Storage:** Clean up unused images/files.
- **Upgrade plans as you grow:** Move to Blaze (pay-as-you-go) for Firebase when needed.
- **Set up budget alerts:** In Firebase and Vercel dashboards.

## 6. To-Do / Next Steps
- [ ] Add real usage metrics as you grow
- [ ] Review costs monthly
- [ ] Add new services as integrated (email, SMS, etc.)
