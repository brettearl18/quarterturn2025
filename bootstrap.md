## 2. Cost-Saving Strategies
- **Founders do more:** Handle product, marketing, and ops in-house.
- **Freelancers/contractors:** Use part-time or contract help for dev/design/support.
- **No office:** Go fully remote.
- **MVP first:** Launch with only core features (directory, prize draw, Stripe payments).
- **No mobile app at launch:** Start web-only.
- **No-code/low-code tools:** Use for admin, CRM, and some user features.
- **Organic growth:** Focus on social, partnerships, and community before paid ads.
- **Referral programs:** Incentivize early users to invite others.
- **Content marketing:** Use blogs, newsletters, and free resources.
- **Start small with prizes:** Use lower-value or partner-donated prizes.
- **Negotiate with partners:** Get gyms/coaches to sponsor prizes.
- **DIY legal:** Use templates and online services for basic docs.
- **Stage licensing:** Only get full trade-promotion licensing when you have traction.
