- **No profile detail page for coaches (scaffolded only)**
- **No admin or professional onboarding dashboard**
- **No user accounts or favorites**
- **No accessibility audit or ARIA roles**
- **No analytics or error monitoring**

## 8. Top Recommendations for MVP
1. **Add authentication (Firebase Auth or NextAuth)**
2. **Implement coach profile detail pages**
3. **Enable real booking and review flows**
4. **Add real-time availability filter (if data exists)**
5. **Add user accounts (favorites, history, etc.)**
6. **Deploy to Vercel or Firebase Hosting**
7. **Accessibility and performance audit**

## 9. Prioritized Roadmap (Next 2 Weeks)

## 11. CTO/PM Notes
- **Project is in excellent shape for MVP demo and user testing.**
- **Mock data ensures a great first impression.**
- **Next focus:** Real user flows, authentication, and deployment.
- **Keep iterating on UI/UX and gather user feedback early.**
